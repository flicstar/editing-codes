# How-To Guide

This guide explains how to use the [editing codes](codes.md) when you're editing.

You can use the codes during:

* The [positivity pass](positivity-pass.md)
* The four phases of [constructive feedback](phases.md)

## Using the codes

### Step One: Identify, reflect and consider

1. Read the piece of writing. 
2. Encounter something that you want to give feedback on.
3. Pause a moment to reflect.
4. Identify the writing principle that you're about to comment on.
5. Find the [code](codes.md) that represents the writing principle.

This takes a bit of getting used to. It can take a while at first, but once you become familiar with the codes it becomes second nature.

### Step Two: Include the code in your feedback

1. Preface your editing feedback with the code. 
2. Explain your comments or suggestions. You don't need to explain the writing principle in your feedback, because this is encapsulated by the semantic editing code. 

You can link to the explainer page for each code as you use it, or you can tell the author you're editing using these [codes](codes.md) and share link to the full list.

ðŸ˜ƒ Include a `++` after the code to acknowledge strengths. We call this the [positivity pass](positivity-pass.md).

## Examples

### Link each code

> [QUOTE](flow-and-sections/quote.md): Consider adding a quote here to support to your point.

> [CRISP++](style-and-phrasing/crisp.md): Really concise and compelling. 


### Link to the full list

> Hey! Nice work on this case study. I used these [codes](codes.md) while I was editing. Let me know if you have any questions.
