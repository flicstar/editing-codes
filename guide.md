# How-To Guide

This guide explains how to use the [editing codes](codes.md) when you're editing.

You can use the codes during:

* The [positivity pass](positivity-pass.md)
* The four phases of [constructive feedback](phases.md)

## Using the codes

### Step One: Identify, reflect and consider

1. Read the piece of writing. 
2. Encounter something that you want to give feedback on.
3. Pause a moment to reflect.
4. Identify the writing principle that you're about to comment on.
5. Find the [code](codes.md) that represents the writing principle.

This takes a bit of getting used to. It can take a while at first, but once you become familiar with the codes it becomes second nature.

### Step Two: Include the code in your feedback

1. Preface your editing feedback with the code. 
2. Link to the explainer page for that code, or the full list of [codes](codes.md).
3. Explain your comments or suggestions. 

You don't need to explain the writing principle, because this is encapsulated by the semantic editing code. 

## Examples

In GitHub, use the code followed by a colon:

> [QUOTE](../quote.md): Consider adding a quote here to support to your point.

In Google Docs, use the code then start your feedback on a new line:

> [REPET](../repet.md)
> Hmm, we've used this word a few times now. Let's try for a synonym.
