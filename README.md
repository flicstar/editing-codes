# Editing Codes

[codes.md](codes.md) is a collection of short, semantic editing marks to use when you're editing a piece of written content.

Editing shouldn't be a black box. These codes communicate the rationale behind a suggested edit, based on a specific writing guideline.

When reviewing a written piece of content, use a code to support your editorial comment or suggestion. 

## How to use the codes

They are organized into four [editing phases](phases.md) and help you edit consistently. 

See the [How-to Guide](guide.md) to learn how to use the codes when you're editing.

## Contributing to the codes

We've based the editing codes on principles in our Writing Guide. This is a living collection - if we missed something, please log an issue to let us know.

You can use these codes as-is, or clone this repo and add your own codes to support your in-house style guide.
