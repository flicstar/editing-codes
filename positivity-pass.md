# Positivity Pass

The positivity pass is meant to:

* Improve the written work.
* Provide guidance to the writer to learn from the editing process, and be able to apply the learning in future writing.
* Help editors be more systematic, methodical, and grow to be better, more transparent editors.
* Helps writers repeat and strengthen their good habits.

## How to do it

1. Read through the written piece. 
2. Note the positive elements of the work. 
   Consider: What are the overarching strengths, significant accomplishments, and powerful communication aspects of the work?
3. Use the [editing codes](codes.md) and include `++` with the code, along with specific praise.

   > [++FRONT](scope-and-narrative-structure/front.md)  Good work on the introductory paragraph. You've set the scene nicely. 

   > [++METPH](style-and-phrasing/metph.md) This metaphor about a log jam to describe the process is fantastic. Let's extend that across the whole article. 

Another approach is to write a block of positivity at the top of the article describing things that were done well.

## Why do it?

### Celebration and kudos

Give your writer a boost! Everyone likes to see that their work is recognized. 

It can be deflating seeing a sea of corrections, suggestions, markup, and strike-throughs when you get a piece back from review. The positivity pass softens the initial 
impact of seeing a seemingly complete re-write on your written work.

### Recognize the craft: I see you

Writing is hard. Most editors are also writers, and know how much effort goes into crafting a written piece. 

The positivity pass shows the writer that the editor has considered and recognized your effort. It also demonstrates that the editor has read the piece through in its entirety. 

Using the [editing codes](codes.md) means you‚Äôre not just going with your gut or paying lip service. The editing codes compel you to tie the compliments to a writing principle, 
which makes the positive feedback much more meaningful for the writer.

### Continue to do this please

The positivity pass reinforces when a writer is doing something well, and you want them to continue doing things that way.

It means that you‚Äôre not just (nit) picking out all the things that need to be improved.
 
It helps to know what to keep, even if that paragraph has to move or if sentences around that phrase change. You can 
be sure to retain the good work that the author has put in.
